# The Quadric Surface Generator
Quadric surfaces are 3D extensions of conics in the Euclidean plane. There are 6 main types I hope to include in this 
program:
- Ellipsoid (or sphere if *a=b=c*)
- Elliptic paraboloid
- Hyperbolic paraboloid
- Elliptic cone
- Hyperboloid of one sheet
- Hyperboloid of two sheets
## What will the application do?
This application is intended to be a study device for identifying quadric surfaces solely based of their equation.
Each of the quadric surfaces have distinct criteria for there equations, for example, an ellipsoid's equation must have
every variable *x,y,z* be positive. The user will input the number of questions they want generated, and the program 
will generate that number of quadric equations for the student to identify. They will be able to type in a box their 
answer, and if it's correct they can proceed to the next question. Infinitley.

## Who will use it?
There are a few groups that could benefit from this program:
- Math 200 students
- Professors who are annoyed with math 200 students constantly asking for more worksheets on identifying quadric 
surfaces, since 10 questions per unit is not nearly enough. In this case, they could just give the program to the 
students and have it generate infinite questions, thus never recieving a complaint about "not enough homework" ever 
again.
- Me
- My TA who, when prompted, gave the example of a **square** when listing quadric surfaces.

## Why is this project of interest?
This idea came to mind when I was studying for my math exam which included the concept of identifying quadric surfaces. 
I looked for a simple program that would generate quadric surfaces for me to work on, since online worksheets proved to 
be unreliable and too short. To my surprise, no such program exists, so I thought it would be neat to make one!
